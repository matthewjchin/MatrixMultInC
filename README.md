MatrixMultInC
---------------------

File name: matrix.c <br>
Creator: Matthew Chin (matthewjchin) <br>

Description: 
A program written in C that takes a 3x4 and a 4x2 matrix that does matrix multiplication.

The result of matrix multiplication for the functionality done in matrix.c is calculated
to be a 3x2 matrix as a result of the number of columns for the first matrix matching the
same value of the number of rows for the second matrix. 

In future: Will allow for two different matrices of different dimensions, without limits. 
Also: Check for invalid dimenstions of matrices when multiplying as well as matrix addition.
